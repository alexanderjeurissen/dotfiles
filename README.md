# My personal dotfiles using Neovim + Tmux + Alacritty

Feel free to use the scripts in this repository to fine tune your own dotfiles. Some things you might want to check out:

1. Neovim configuration with custom statusline, and several nifty bindings and settings.
2. Several shell aliases that I gathered over the years.
3. Custom zsh prompt.
3. Tmux statusline
