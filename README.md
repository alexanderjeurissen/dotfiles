# My personal dotfiles used in conjunction with thoughtbot/rcm

Feel free to use the scripts in this repository to fine tune your own dotfiles. Some things you might want to check out:

1. very modular vim setup using plugingroups which contain plugins configuration files that contain all
   mappings, settings etc.
2. A lightweight alternative wrapper for tmux-powerline segments. only the ones I use (and some I made myself) are included
   but it should be quite easy to add additional ones.
