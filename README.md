# My personal dotfiles using Neovim + Tmux + Alacritty

Feel free to use the scripts in this repository to fine tune your own dotfiles. Some things you might want to check out:

1. Neovim configuration with custom statusline, and several nifty bindings and settings.
2. Several shell aliases that I gathered over the years.
3. Custom zsh prompt.
3. Tmux pomodoro segment that can be invoked with Ctrl+t+p
2. A lightweight alternative wrapper for tmux-powerline segments. only the ones I use (and some I made myself) are included
   but it should be quite easy to create new segments.
