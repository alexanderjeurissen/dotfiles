## Disclaimer

This repo contains the latest and greatest version of my dotfiles.
I try to extract meaningful bits and pieces to separate plugins/repositories so they can be used by the broader public, however tweaks that are highly personal preference often first end up here before I decide what to do with them.

In summary my work environment consists of:

| purpose | tool |
|---------|------|
| editor | Neovim |
| terminal multiplexer | Tmux |
| shell | Fish |
| terminal application | Alacritty |
