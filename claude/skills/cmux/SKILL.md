# cmux Core Control

Use this skill to control non-browser cmux topology and routing.

## Core Concepts

- Window: top-level macOS cmux window.
- Workspace: tab-like group within a window.
- Pane: split container in a workspace.
- Surface: a tab within a pane (terminal or browser panel).

## Fast Start

```bash
# identify current caller context
cmux identify --json

# list topology
cmux list-windows
cmux list-workspaces
cmux list-panes
cmux list-pane-surfaces --pane pane:1

# create/focus/move
cmux new-workspace
cmux new-split right --panel pane:1
cmux move-surface --surface surface:7 --pane pane:2 --focus true
cmux split-off --surface surface:7 right
cmux reorder-surface --surface surface:7 --before surface:3

# attention cue
cmux trigger-flash --surface surface:7
```

## Settings and Docs

Use `cmux docs settings` before changing cmux-owned settings. It prints the docs URL, schema URL, raw GitHub resources, cmux.json paths, and reload command.

```bash
cmux docs settings
cmux settings path
```

cmux-owned settings live in `~/.config/cmux/cmux.json`. Legacy `~/.config/cmux/settings.json` and `~/Library/Application Support/com.cmuxterm.app/settings.json` files are read only as fallback for missing keys. Before editing, copy any existing `cmux.json` file to a timestamped `.bak` next to it so the user can revert. Edit the user file, then reload:

```bash
cmux reload-config
```

`cmux reload-config` reloads BOTH `cmux.json` and Ghostty config (`~/.config/ghostty/config`) and refreshes terminals in place. No app restart needed.

Use cmux settings for app behavior, sidebar, notifications, browser behavior, automation, workspace colors, and cmux-owned shortcuts. Terminal rendering settings such as font, cursor style, theme, scrollback, background transparency (`background-opacity`), and blur (`background-blur`) belong in Ghostty config at `~/.config/ghostty/config`.

Open the UI when useful:

```bash
cmux settings
cmux settings cmux-json
cmux settings shortcuts
```

## Handle Model

- Default output uses short refs: `window:N`, `workspace:N`, `pane:N`, `surface:N`.
- UUIDs are still accepted as inputs.
- Request UUID output only when needed: `--id-format uuids|both`.
