# Setup Goal

Turn an idea into a goal package at `goals/<slug>/` through structured discovery, user interview, and codebase exploration.

## Phases

### 1. Rearticulate

State back what the user wants in your own words. If the conversation already has rich context, summarize it. If the goal is bare or vague, do minimal shallow exploration of the codebase to ground your understanding. Keep it to 2-3 sentences. Wait for the user to confirm or correct before continuing.

Create the goal directory once the slug is clear:

```bash
mkdir -p goals/<slug>
```

Use `goals/<slug>/` for both working JSON files and final docs. The JSON files are provenance and iteration state; the markdown files are the human-readable authoritative goal package.

**Browser session patience rule:** Plannotator goal setup is a user-driven browser session. After launching an interview or facts command, be absolutely patient and keep waiting on the user until they submit, dismiss, or explicitly ask you to stop. Do not close, kill, restart, refresh, or open a second copy just because the UI is idle or the user is taking time. Never close and reopen the session as a way to update state; if a rerun is needed after the prior session ends, update the working JSON file and launch a new command from that file.

**Optional: grill first (deep, one-at-a-time interview).** Before building the compact interview bundle, *suggest* a grilling pass whenever the goal is vague or carries many interdependent decisions — and run one whenever the user asks for it ("grill me first"). This is opt-in: for a clear, well-scoped goal, skip it and go straight to the bundle, so grilling never fights the bundle's "fewer, higher-leverage questions" philosophy. When you grill, run the protocol below verbatim, then fold the resolved decisions forward into a higher-quality interview bundle (Phase 2) — or, if grilling fully resolves scope, straight into the fact sheet (Phase 3).

<!-- Grilling protocol below adapted verbatim from the /grill-me skill by Matt Pocock (MIT-licensed):
     https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/blob/main/skills/productivity/grill-me/SKILL.md -->

> Interview me relentlessly about every aspect of this plan until we reach a shared understanding. Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one. For each question, provide your recommended answer.
>
> Ask the questions one at a time.
>
> If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore the codebase instead.

### 2. Interview Bundle

Build a compact bundle of questions that can derive every "fact" this goal should produce. Package the questions together so the user can answer them quickly in the Plannotator goal setup UI. For each question, include your recommended answer and use options when they make answering faster.

Do not ask obvious confirmation questions. If the answer can be inferred from the user's request, from the conversation, or from shallow codebase exploration, infer it and move on. If an obvious area has meaningful nuance, present the inferred answer as a recommendation with options or a custom "add/correct this" path rather than asking the user to restate the obvious.

Question areas that usually matter:

- What the feature/change is
- Who it's for
- What problem it solves
- What behavior changes
- What success looks like
- What's in and out of scope (the most important area to determine facts)
- What edge cases to consider
- What constraints or precedent apply

**If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore the codebase instead of asking.** Only include questions where the user's judgment is actually needed. Prefer fewer, higher-leverage questions over exhaustive obvious ones.

Write the interview bundle before showing it to the user:

`goals/<slug>/interview.json`

```json
{
  "stage": "interview",
  "title": "Short human-readable title",
  "goalSlug": "<slug>",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "scope",
      "prompt": "What should be in scope?",
      "description": "Optional clarification.",
      "answerMode": "multi-custom",
      "recommendedAnswer": "Your recommended answer.",
      "recommendedOptionIds": ["ui", "server"],
      "options": [
        { "id": "ui", "label": "UI" },
        { "id": "server", "label": "Server" }
      ],
      "required": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Supported `answerMode` values: `text`, `single`, `multi`, `custom`, `single-custom`, `multi-custom`.

Run this as a monitored foreground process and wait patiently for the browser session to finish. The command may appear idle while the user is reading, editing, or asking questions; leave it running:

```bash
plannotator setup-goal interview goals/<slug>/interview.json --json
```

The command returns JSON on stdout with the submitted answers. Write that exact result to `goals/<slug>/interview-result.json` before continuing. A convenient pattern is:

```bash
plannotator setup-goal interview goals/<slug>/interview.json --json | tee goals/<slug>/interview-result.json
```

If the user revises after the session finishes, update `interview.json` and rerun the command instead of reconstructing the whole bundle from memory. If the session is dismissed, stop and tell the user the goal setup was closed.

Before moving to facts, read every answer and note carefully:

- If the user wrote questions, uncertainty, "not sure", "needs context", or similar concerns in an answer or note, stop and address those questions in chat. Do not proceed to facts until the user has enough context or you have rerun a revised interview bundle.
- If the user skipped a question with a note, treat the note as intentional feedback, not as an empty answer. Answer the note, refine the question, or make a documented assumption before proceeding.
- If the user skipped a question without a note, proceed only if the missing answer is non-blocking; otherwise ask the smallest possible follow-up in chat.

### 3. Fact Sheet

A fact is a simple description of each outcome of a goal. It should be easily testable and verifiable. A fact may describe the function of a specific feature or aspect of a system. A fact may determine specific UI and UX. Again, a fact is literally anything that can be tested and verified in automated or manual testing. Keep fact language simple. In a way, a fact sheet is a design spec, but less verbose & using language the human user can easily visualize & rationalize. 

Prepare a facts review bundle from `goals/<slug>/interview-result.json`. Each fact should include whether automated verification is recommended and preselected.

Write the facts review bundle before showing it to the user. If revising after a prior facts pass, start from `facts-review.json` and `facts-result.json`, include previously accepted facts with `"accepted": true`, and preserve their state.

`goals/<slug>/facts-review.json`

```json
{
  "stage": "facts",
  "title": "Short human-readable title",
  "goalSlug": "<slug>",
  "facts": [
    {
      "id": "fact-1",
      "text": "The accepted fact text.",
      "accepted": false,
      "removed": false,
      "recommendedAutomatedVerification": true,
      "automatedVerification": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Run this as a monitored foreground process and wait patiently for the browser session to finish. The command may appear idle while the user is reviewing, editing, or asking questions; leave it running:

```bash
plannotator setup-goal facts goals/<slug>/facts-review.json --json
```

The command returns JSON on stdout with accepted/edited/removed facts plus automated verification selections. Write that exact result to `goals/<slug>/facts-result.json`. A convenient pattern is:

```bash
plannotator setup-goal facts goals/<slug>/facts-review.json --json | tee goals/<slug>/facts-result.json
```

Write `goals/<slug>/facts.md` as a flat readable list of accepted facts. Each fact is one line; add a minimal note only when the fact cannot be stated clearly on its own. Also write `goals/<slug>/facts.meta.json` preserving each accepted fact's `id`, final `text`, `comment`, `recommendedAutomatedVerification`, and `automatedVerification` value.

If the user edits or removes facts in the UI, apply that result directly. If the session is dismissed, stop and tell the user the facts review was closed.

### 4. Plan

Explore the codebase. Discover and validate implementation paths toward each accepted fact. Treat facts with `automatedVerification: true` as requiring concrete automated checks unless you document a blocker. Trace through code, identify files and systems involved, surface risks and unknowns. Refine until you have a confident order of operations.

Write `goals/<slug>/plan.md`:

- Solution approach (brief)
- Ordered steps with the files/systems each touches
- Verification for each step (concrete commands or checks)
- Risks or open questions worth flagging

Gate the plan with Plannotator:

```bash
plannotator annotate goals/<slug>/plan.md --gate
```

If denied, revise from feedback and re-gate until approved.

### 5. Goal Output

Write `goals/<slug>/goal.md`:

- The articulated goal (1-3 sentences)
- Reference to `facts.md` as the shared understanding
- Reference to `plan.md` as the execution plan
- Done condition

Tell the user:

```
Done! Launch a goal with `/goal goals/<slug>/goal.md`
```
