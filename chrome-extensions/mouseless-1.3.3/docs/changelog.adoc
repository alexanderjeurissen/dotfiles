 * Fixed issues with certain keys not working with certain keyboard layouts

## 1.2.57
 * Miscellaneous bug fixes

## 1.2.56
 * **Important!** The behavior of commands that open links (`:open`, `:tabnew`, `:history`, etc) has changed. See [the mappings page](./mappings.html#tabs) for more information.
 * Awesome new feature! It's now possible to use Vim to edit text boxes. All that is needed is a python script that can be found [here](https://github.com/1995eaton/chromium-vim/blob/master/cvim_server.py)
  * To get things running, just run the script: `python cvim_socket.py` and press `<C-i>` inside a text box.
 * As a result of the above, the insert mapping `<C-i>` (beginningOfLine) is now `<C-a>`.
 * Smoother scrolling
 * Added `:tabattach` command
 * Settings defined via the command bar (e.g. `:set nosmoothscroll`) will become active in all other tabs and all new tabs until either the browser is restarted or the settings is flipped
 * Page searches are now synced with other tabs
 * Performance enhancements

## 1.2.55
 * In order to make cVim as "vim-like" as possible, some commands have been added, and others have changed (the old ones will continue to work). `:tabopen` is now `:tabnew` and `:closetab` is now `:quit`
 * The `C-z` toggleCvim mapping is now `A-z` due to conflicts with the default undo-text Chrome shortcut.
 * Added `goToLastInput` command (`gI`)
 * The yank-link hint mode binding has changed from `Y` to `gy`
 * Yank link hint mode will now copy text box values/placeholders in addition to link URLs.

## 1.2.54
 * The ```ignorediacritics``` option has been removed due to its large performance impact
 * Added the ```*``` modifier to the open group of commands (e.g. ```:tabopen http://www.google.com*``` will open Google in a pinned state)
   * This can be used in addition to the ```&``` modifier (e.g. ```:tabopen http://www.google.com*&``` or ```:tabopen http://www.google.com&*``` will open Google in a pinned background tab
 * Fixed a CSS style injection bug on some sites
 * Improved keyboard key support
 * Added experimental GitHub autocomplete search engine (e.g. ```:tabopen github @1995eaton/```)

## 1.2.53
 * **Important!** cVimrc blacklists are now a part of the cVimrc. Previous blacklists should carry over to the cVimrc text area. New blacklists can be declared like this:
```vim
let blacklists = ["https://www.google.com"]
```
 * When defining custom search engines, you can now add the string ```%s``` somewhere inside the URL to indicate that the query should be inserted in this place. This is useful for search engines with URLs that have non-standard structures. For instance:

```vim
" If you search for 'test' using this engine, cVim
" will open this link -> http://www.example.com/test?type=search
let searchengine example = "http://www.example.com/%s?type=search"

" In the case below, '%s' is optional. If it is not included, your search query will be appended to the URL
let searchengine example = "http://www.example.com/search?query="
let searchengine example = "http://www.example.com/search?query=%s" "This is no different from the above case
```
 * Added lastScrollPosition ```''```, goToMark ```'<*>```, and setMark ```;<*>``` mappings
 * Find-mode is much, much faster (outperforms Google's search mode when looking for the letter 'a' in a text copy of *The Great Gatsby*)
 * Several bugfixes
 * Added searchalias and locale variables (see help file ```:help```)

## 1.2.52
 * Added the ```file``` command
 * Added the ```date``` command
 * Improved link hint performance
 * The reverseImageSearch mapping can now parse base64 images (thanks to Google's "Search by Image" extension)
 * Added the closeTab command to the chrome://extensions -&gt; Keyboard Shortcuts page
 * Improved cVim response time on initial page load
 * Minor bugfixes

## 1.2.51
 * **Important!** cVimrc setting are now stricter. You must use 'let' instead of set when using options requiring an equal symbol. For example:
```vim
set hintcharacters = abc123 "Incorrect!
let hintcharacters = "abc123" "Correct
```
 * Added completionengines option to cVimrc (choose which completion engines to display). For example:
```vim
let completionengines = ["google", "imdb"] "Only these engines will appear in the search autocomplete menu
```
 * Added autohidecursor option (useful for Linux operating systems, which don't automatically hide the mouse cursor when a key is pressed). You can test this out by running the command ```:set autohidecursor``` and scrolling with j/k (might have to nudge mouse cursor then scroll to see it disappear initially).
 * Bug fixes

## 1.2.50
 * ```map``` automatically unmaps the existing binding if a conflict occurs (e.g. same key mapped to multiple functions). ```unmap``` is no longer necessary unless you wish to disable a default mapping
 * ```map``` can now point to other mappings as a reference (e.g. ```map j k```)
 * Improved mapping key compatibility
 * Minor CSS tweaks in the options page

## 1.2.49
 * Reworked domain blacklists engine. See https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/match_patterns for a description of the new URL match syntax
 * Fixed some iframe bugs

## 1.2.48
 * Fixed an issue where quickmarks wouldn't save
 * Minor bugfixes
 * Added basic support for Visual Line mode (V)
 * Updated DuckDuckGo search engine for completion
 * Added a restart chrome shortcut (zr). The same could be accomplished with the config ```map zr :chrome://restart&<CR>```
 * reloadAllTabs is still available for mapping, but the key binding ```cr``` now defaults to reloadAllButCurrent

## 1.2.47
 * Several bugfixes
 * Added reloadAllTabs (cr), toggleImages (ci), zoomPageIn (zi), zoomPageOut (zo), zoomOrig (z0), zoomImage (z&lt;Enter&gt;), and toggleCvim (&lt;C-z&gt;) mappings

## 1.2.46
 * Fixed a bug where bookmarks would be displayed multiple times on some sites

## 1.2.45
 * Fixed a CSS issue with the default font (if your font looks ugly, reset cVim to see changes).

## 1.2.44
 * Tiny bugfix

## 1.2.43
 * Added this changelog
