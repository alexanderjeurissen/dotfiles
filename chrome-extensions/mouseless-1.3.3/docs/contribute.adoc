== Ideas

it is fine to log tickets (labeled #idea) to brainstorm ideas and suggest workflows. Take the time to clear it your head first.
https://github.com/hbt/mouseless/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aidea

Unlike enhancement requests, idea requests are vague and often lack a design proposal on how to implement it. 

== Code review

. watch the repository https://github.com/hbt/mouseless
. comment on pull request and what needs to be done to meet guideline <<Pull request guideline>>
. comment on implementation, potential bugs, performance issues, code quality etc.


== Community support

This is the most time consuming of all and any help is appreciated.

. watch the repository https://github.com/hbt/mouseless
. answer tickets label as #question to the best of your ability https://github.com/hbt/mouseless/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aquestion 
. don't let shitty people get to you ;-) They are a tiny minority but your brain will exaggerate their effect


== Documentation

Improving documentation by:

- fixing typos
- sharing tips like cool configuration tricks, mappings etc. link:tips.html[view tips]
- doing other type of grunt work which is appreciated but time consuming https://github.com/hbt/mouseless/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Agrunt_work

== Pull request guideline

. create branch and commit work referring to ticket
. commits should refer to ticket number created in https://github.com/hbt/mouseless/issues 
. minimal changes in diffs
. update docs/commands.md docs/settings.md if relevant
. wait at least a week for a maintainer to review and merge your changes

NOTE: Do not bother proposing a mapping. It will be ignored. Add the new function as an isolated module and it will be merged.
